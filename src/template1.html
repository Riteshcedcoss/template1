        William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business
        magnate, software developer, investor, author, and philanthropist. He is
        a co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul
        Allen.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of
        chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software
        architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May
        2014.[4] He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of
        the 1970s and 1980s.

        Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen
        founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's
        largest personal computer software company.[5][a] Gates led the company
        as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000,
        succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of
        directors and became chief software architect.[8] During the late 1990s,
        he was criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered
        anti-competitive.
